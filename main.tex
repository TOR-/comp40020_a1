\AbstractBox{
	This report will:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item With songs from two different artists (King Crimson and Johnny Cash) use the tools introduced in the module to identify similarities and differences in the style of language used.
		\item Identify defining features of the above artists and assess their utility in guessing an unseen song.
		\item Discuss a context where this analytical approach could apply to another task related to the author's own academic background, electronic engineering.
		\item Discuss necessary additions or alterations to the approach to better perform the above-mentioned task.
	\end{itemize}
